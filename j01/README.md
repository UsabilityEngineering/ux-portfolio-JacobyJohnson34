I’m a mechanical engineering major, so I use the [Solidworks](https://my.solidworks.com/try-solidworks?mktid=13829&utm_campaign=202007_nam_sw_GoogleSWOPT_en_XOP2050_rise_brand_us_exact&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=search&utm_term=Cj0KCQjw1aOpBhCOARIsACXYv-doQkbsR_1L5VhMSsWnW6K2-uTgpJCAYLi0ssZIAn2Snk5Rfy_6c3QaAlhKEALw_wcB&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1aOpBhCOARIsACXYv-doQkbsR_1L5VhMSsWnW6K2-uTgpJCAYLi0ssZIAn2Snk5Rfy_6c3QaAlhKEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) software quite a bit for my projects. However when making a quick and easy part I tend to use a lesser known software called [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free). This software allows you to draw objects in a 3D space which makes it much easier to use compared to most design softwares which only allow you to draw in 2D.

The software does a great job following the usability guideline of having an **aesthetic and minimalist design.** This comes from the fact that there is very little on the screen. The left side of the screen has all the sketching tools in a row down the screen in boxes. The right side has some more advanced features for possibilities of how to use your model once it is finished. They are also in boxes in a row. The limited amount of tools makes this software very **memorable** since there is very little to keep track of in order to use the software **effectively**.

In the picture above you can see the interface and its simplicity. The ordering of the tools is very **efficient**. The boxes take up a very small amount of space on the screen while also providing understandable pictures. Also if the pictures are not clear enough, you can drag your mouse over a tool and it will tell you what the tool is.

I wanted to use sketchup to make a simple, 3d rectangle with a hole in it. I started by drawing the base of the rectangle. Drawing in sketchup is very **satisfying** because of the ease of making lines 90 degrees from each other. When drawing a line, it will automatically make it follow either the green, red, or blue line at a parallel angle if you aim the endpoint of your line in a similar direction to one of the colored lines. For my drawing, I drew a four inch line parallel to the green line, and then an eight inch line parallel to the red line. This made half of the rectangular base. 

When trying to complete the rectangular base, I accidentally made one of the sides nine inches instead of eight. I was able to **recover from the error** with a simple undo arrow located at the top left of the screen, which is a common **convention** for all design softwares like sketchup. This also demonstrates a great example of **user control** for the software. I was easily able to undo my mistake without any confusion or frustration.

After completing the rectangular base, I used the pull tool to make my rectangle ten inches tall by pulling it parallel to the blue line. The simplicity of this software makes the whole experience very enjoyable. The most enjoyable feature was probably the colored lines. These lines were extremely **useful** because they saved me a lot of time from having to estimate angles.

I lastly made my hole by drawing a rectangle on the side of the object and using the pull command to make the hole. The pull command was dynamic in the fact that it could pull a 2D shape in a direction to make it 3D, but could also be used to push a hole by making a shape on the side of a 3D object and pushing the shape to the opposite side of the object. After this step my project was done.

Overall this software was extremely easy to use and was a very pleasant experience. I had absolutely no errors and was able to complete everything without any issues. The biggest strength I see when it comes to the usability of this software is that it can be learned in a couple of minutes. There aren’t any complicated tools or things to remember to do. The biggest weakness however for this software from a usability standpoint is that it doesn’t provide much **flexibility** for advanced users. There are not a whole lot of tips or tricks that a pro could use to easily breeze through a project.
